It came down to this: launch the boat as is and head down river or wait another year. F*** waiting. It was sprint time. We were literally attaching the netting to the boat while they were driving us toward the launch ramp. I spent about two weeks in the water at the marina finishing up some safety details before Ethan and I took off down river. There were a lot of cosmetic interior details that weren't finished, but it was good enough for us to go.
