Above is the track from my most recent sail. I beat my way up the harbor in a lightish wind and flew the spinnaker for the first time on the lake side (see photo below).

Summer has not yet made its appearance around here, but we've had a few nice spring days. We're currently keeping the boat at Barker's Island Marina in Superior, WI. We're going to stick around Duluth for a bit since Ethan is taking a sailing class from the [Duluth Superior Sailing Association](http://sailingforall.org/) in June, but after that's over, we'll set off to explore this end of Lake Superior as well as enjoy the Duluth area summer festivities.

A childhood friend and his family joined us for our first sail.

I tried to get out for a quick solo sail, but just as I left the marina the weather alerts went bonkers. I anchored in a safe spot and let the brief storm packing 50kt winds pass by.

I finally was able to test out spinnaker sailing and it was amazing. The wind wasn't strong and I was hitting 8kts. It dropped below 10 and I was still doing 5-6. I still have a lot to learn about trimming the sail, and I think it's a bit small for my boat, but I was in bliss.
