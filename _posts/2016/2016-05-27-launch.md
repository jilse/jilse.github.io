We did it! This is my 3rd launch and it gets easier every time. Everything went smoothly due entirely to the pros at Barker's Island Marina. Ethan and I rode in the boat while they drove us the long way round to the launch ramp and then we motored over to a slip just before the rain started again. It couldn't have gone better. You can see most of the track we followed above, but I forgot to start the tracker at the beginning, so it appears like we started in the middle of the road.

we blocked traffic for about 10 minutes, but we let cars pass a few times. We took up both lanes and were going at a slow walking speed.
