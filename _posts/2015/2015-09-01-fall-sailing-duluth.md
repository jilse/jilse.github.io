After the summer fun in August, the weather turned to fall, but the sailing was still excellent. We decided the boat would winter at Barker's Island and we would winter in Duluth, so there was still some time for fun day sails and a quick trip to Grand Marais for a music festival and then on to Isle Royale. I had been dreaming of sailing to Isle Royale for years and wasn't disappointed. It truned out to be a quick trip due to cold and wet weather, but I'm glad we went. We were there for a couple days and a few hikes. It was also our longest passage yet at 140nm. In addition to that, we had a blast taking numerous guests out for day sails around Duluth.
