I pulled into the marina in Leland, MI in the morning. Heather and Ethan arrived late that night. We explored town a bit and eventually sailed off for the islands near Sleeping Bear National Lakeshore. It was an excitement filled couple days where we sailed in big waves, climbed giant sand dunes, and saw some shipwrecks. Sadly, it didn't last long and Heather left for home and Ethan stayed with me to sail on.

To give an idea of the scale of the dune, the trail that runs down the face has a group of dots about 3/4 up. Those are people and this is one of the smaller dunes in the area. The waves were not favorable to stop near the big one.
