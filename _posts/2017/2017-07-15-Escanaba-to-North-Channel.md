The rest of the cruise was very different. Until now, I've spent all my focus on covering miles and finding cell coverage so I can work. Heather and Ethan joined me for the sail home and it was more like a vacation...time to take it easier. While I still kept up with working, I also took some time off. Another on the want to see list for the summer was the fabled North Channel of Lake Huron in Canada. I don't generally believe the hype when people talk up their cruising grounds. There are a lot of great places, but they can't all be the best in the world! This place blew away even the hype. We only scratched the surface in the week or so we were there, and if we're not for schedules and oncoming fall then winter, I'd probably never have left. It's that good. The pictures are amazing, but don't even begin to describe what a gem this place is.
