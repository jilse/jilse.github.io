It was early in the season (June 15) when I left, so that meant fog/cold on Lake Superior. I was in fog about 40 percent of the time while under way. The day I wanted to leave it was 40f and raining. I opted to stay at the dock and pack supplies away.

I may sound like I'm complaining, but especially when I'm alone and don't have to be concerned for other's comfort, I still enjoy my time afloat in adverse weather. I'm probably just describing it to make myself sound tough, which is pretty far from the truth. When it's cold, I'm ususally hiding in my sleeping bag with the propane heater on full blast.

The solitary nature of solo sailing is nice, but I was working remotely at my job on non-sailing days, so I was in regular contact with other humans. I couldn't do it without Verizon 4G.

I did it in 4 legs. 

- Duluth to Copper Harbor (176 nm)
- Copper Harbor to Grand Marais, MI (90 nm) - tried for W.F. point, but wind shift made me redirect
- Grand Marais to Whitefish Point (50 nm)
- Whitefish Point to Sault Ste. Marie (35 nm)

I tend to prefer longer legs, so that I can spend more time hanging in favorite harbors keeping up with my job. I enjoy the sailing days immensely, but swinging on the hook is equally enjoyable to me. When I have to do lots of daily short hops, I have a hard time keeping up with business. All in all, the trip across Lake Superior was without major excitement, and filled with beautiful remote areas that you can only see by boat.
