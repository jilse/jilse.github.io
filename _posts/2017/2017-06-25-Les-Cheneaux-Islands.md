I was so lucky, once again, to find a secluded anchorage in the Les Cheneaux Islands with great 4G to wait out some weather. I just sat swinging on the hook for a few days keeping up with work, enjoying the quiet, and watching the Loons. They seem to love to come out on gray rainy days. Maybe the fishing is good. 

At this point, I was 500 nm into the trip and still hadn't shared an Anchorage with another boat. In fact I had only seen one other pleasure boat underway.
