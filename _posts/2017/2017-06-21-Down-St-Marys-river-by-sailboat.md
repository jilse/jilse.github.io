St. Mary's river connects lake Superior to Lake Huron which makes it a major highway for the huge lakers and salties (international ocean going ships)that transport goods across the great lakes and over-seas. The last time I transited the river it was a dark dark night and it turns out my vhf wasn't receiving, so I had a scary crossing in a narrow cut. This time couldn't have been more different. It was a bright-blue-sky-sunny type day. I left the Soo in the morning, under sail, screaming down wind and down current. I normally expect to motor on rivers but the wind was perfect. Lucky me.
