This next stretch was a slog. I waited as long as I could in Les Cheneaux Islands, but i needed to be underway. I spent 70 miles slamming into headwinds and waves in the narrow mackinaw straights. I was so happy to arrive in Charlevoix, but as it turns out, this place was way to fancy for me. However, it was a well protected anchorage which are few and far between in this part of Lake Michigan, so I stayed for a few days and... You guessed it. Worked. I was badly missing my cove and the loons in Les Cheneaux.
