After the north channel, our schedule was dictated by covering ground to get to the apostle Islands, near home, in time for Ethan's annual birthday camp weekend where friends ferry out to meet us at the amazing Stockton island. We stopped in Sault Ste Marie and happened to be there for the start of the trans superior yacht race. The George Kemp marina was completely packed and it was fun to see the fancy race boats and catch up with sailor friends. I'm not a racer, but I enjoyed the atmosphere.
